## 🌟 Core Vision

1.  **Safety for Everyone**: Bring high-end safety features (eCall, Crash Detection) to any smartphone owner, not just those with new cars.
2.  **Privacy First**: All sensor data is processed locally on the device.
3.  **Open Standards**: publishing standard protocols for OBD-II communication and crash signatures.
